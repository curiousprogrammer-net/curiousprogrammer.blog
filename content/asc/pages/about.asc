Hi, my name is https://jurajmartinka.com/[Juraj Martinka^] and I’m the author of the Curious (Clojure) Programmer blog.
A long time ago, I’ve created this blog with the following goals in my mind:

* To Learn Clojure and ClojureScript by Example
* To share my experience with other people who strive to find an effective learning process

Gradually, I've included more topics and these days I mostly blog about anything related to
*Clojure, Java/JVM, Linux, performance, networking, security, Cloud services (mostly AWS)*
and sometimes even (rock) climbing.


## About me

I’m a curious software developer with the passion for Learning, Self-improvement and Problem solving.
I’ve been coding professionally in Java since 2008 and in Clojure since 2017 (did a few short gigs and then joined CodeScene in May, 2017).

Nowadays, I enjoy working full-time with Clojure on CodeScene (code/project analysis tool).

I was an organizer of https://www.meetup.com/fpbrno/[Functional Programming Brno meetup^]
and I still hope to revive https://www.meetup.com/brno-clojure/[Brno Clojure meetup^] at some point.
