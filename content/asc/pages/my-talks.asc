Slides (PDF): https://curiousprogrammer.net/GdgJihlava-CodeScene.pdf

Abstract:
* Traditional static code analysis tools (Sonar et al.) are notoriously bad at producing actionable insights (what does the “4000 years of accumulated technical debt” really mean?)
* CodeScene takes a different approach and focuses instead on how code evolves over time using a treasure trove we all posses – version control history.
* Come and meet CodeScene, a unique behavioral code analysis tool that looks for patterns in version control data to understand the history and evolution of a codebase: unraveling things like hotspots, change coupling between modules and interesting social aspects of the code.
* I’ll describe the ideas behind CodeScene, how it works and demonstrate the techniques on analyses of real projects.
