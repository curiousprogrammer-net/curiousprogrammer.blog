Weekly summaries of interesting, surprising, and worth-to-remember concepts, facts, ideas, experiences, events, tools/libraries, etc. Itâ€™s something that I did, learned, or found in the past week.

I focus on practical advice mostly related to programming. I work daily with Clojure & JVM so most of the topics are loosely related to them.

But I cover a large range of topics: Learning & Problem solving, Computer science fundamentals, Operating systems / Linux, Networking, Distributed systems, Data science, Project management, and some portion of my hobbies.

You can think of it as a personal weekly journal or an email newsletter.
