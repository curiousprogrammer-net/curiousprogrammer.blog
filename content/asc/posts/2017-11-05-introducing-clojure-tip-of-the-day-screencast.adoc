I've started a new Clojure screencast Clojure Tip of the Day.
It's going to be a collection of short (~5 min) videos covering various Clojure tips, tools, and techniques.
I'd like to add a new episode at least once a week.

The first episode is about Cider debugger.
It was inspired by a comment on my https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ecC3jqHooc[Clojure Development Workflow with Spacemacs and Cider] video tutorial.

You can find the episode on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHCch3-Yuac.

See https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging/[Cider Debugging documentation] for more details.
