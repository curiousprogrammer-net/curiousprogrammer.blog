The new episode of my https://curiousprogrammer.net/clojure-tip-of-the-day-screencast/[Clojure Tip of the Day] screencast is out.

You can find the video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/tCu2AewBTR4

The episode covers the https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/miscellaneous_features/#enlighten-display-local-values[cider-enlighten-mode].
This mode can be used to quickly show values of local symbols and return values of functions in real time.
Unfortunately, the feature is https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/doc/caveats.md[not available in ClojureScript buffers].

Notice, that unlike for http://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging/[cider-debugger] _(cider-debug-print-length_ and _cider-debug-print-level__),_ there's no option to customize the _print-length_ for the enlighten mode (see _Cider implementation details_ below).

== *Cider implementation details*:

* main function handling enlighten mode: https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/ba66d222a8ce4c1b1b2f5ced3ce8143334ceae1e/cider-debug.el#L646[_cider--handle-enligthen_]
* https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/blob/master/src/cider/nrepl/middleware/enlighten.clj#L13[hardcoded limit] (*print-length* 3) in cider-nrepl
* https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1545[Pull Request #1545] that introduced the cider-enlighten-mode
