There's going to be a very interesting functional meetup _*LambdUp*_ in Prague (CZ) on 6th December 2017 organized by https://www.blueberry.io/[Blueberry].

I first heard about the event from Eric Normand at Clojure/conj 2017 in Baltimore.
It's not a coincidence that Eric is also one of the speakers invited to the meetup:

It's a real shame that I cannot visit the meetup since I'm away at that time, but if you happen to be around, give it a shot.
