After a long break, I've finally recorded another episode of the https://curiousprogrammer.net/clojure-tip-of-the-day-screencast/[Clojure Tip of The Day screencast].
I've spent last month or so by revisiting my goals for the next year and I want to bring more consistency to my blog and other creative activities.

This episode is about thread-first (\->), thread-last (->>), and thread-last (as\->) macros.
Again, you can find it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0CxOHmny80

The next episode will be about _some\->_, _some->>_, _cond\->_, and _cond\->_.

You can find the source code on GitHub in https://github.com/curiousprogrammer-net/clojure-tip-of-the-day/blob/master/src/clojure_tip_of_the_day/004_threading_macros.clj[curiousprogrammer-net/clojure-tip-of-the-day repository].
