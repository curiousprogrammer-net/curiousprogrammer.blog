_This is a summary of the defn podcast interview with Bruce Hauman._

Once again, it's been a https://defn.audio/episodes/2018/02/10/bruce-hauman.html[great and long episode] where Ray and Vijay talked to https://github.com/bhauman[Bruce Hauman].
You'll find my notes below.

These are my notes to help me quickly review the key information.
I might have misinterpreted something.
I encourage you to listen to the https://defn.audio/episodes/2018/02/10/bruce-hauman.html[full episode].

 

== *Summary*

* Name _Hauman_ has German origin.
* *How he got to Clojure and Figwheel*
** He likes languages, parsing et al.
** He has always had a passion for LISP - he was LISPer for a long time (since college).
** In the real world, you work with Ruby, PHP, Java, etc.
*** As a result, he got sick and started to play with ClojureScript - there were quite a few rough edges and thus he created https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel[Figwheel].

** Now Bruce lives in a typical apartment in Montreal.
*** See his talk https://youtu.be/j-kj2qwJa_E?t=557[Developing ClojureScript With Figwheel] with the picture of his former "plastic bubble" house :).

** ClojureScript doesn't "encapsulate" functions and modules.
*** You can just load the file, and all your definitions are reloaded \=> very easy.
*** If you want to do stateful stuff like https://threejs.org/ it becomes problematic \=> you can turn auto-loading on and off with Figwheel.

** Using Figwheel with Node.js is different.
*** You have no display and feedback is less visible.

* Joke: _he's not a real programmer, he just build cool demos that make people think._
 ** Figwheel is quite complicated real application written in Clojure.

* He recently built some application with Clojure and Ethereum - that was a really cool experience.
* *Clojure as a strange maximum*
** He doesn't see himself gravitating to other languages (although he loves languages a lot).
** In terms of getting things done, he sees little benefits in using other languages.

* *Static types*
** The static guys are overblowing guarantee they're getting from types - in real-world complex systems with lots of state (think "Microservices") the benefits are diminished.
** In Clojure we are very productive - look at https://github.com/bhauman/advent-of-clojure[Advent of Code] and compare Clojure solutions to other languages.
** Ray: certain types of functions would benefit from types but exploring external resources and APIs/data is much easier without types ceremony.
** Racket, gradual typing, etc.
(Vijay asked Bruce what he thinks about that and what's his experience)
*** Paying upfront cost with types doesn't make much sense to him because so much programming is about exploration - Bruce prefers to have the flexibility to explore.

* *Building new Clojure/ClojureScript app* - what are his libraries/tools of choice?
** Pick as few libraries as possible.
** He (always) uses React for frontend applications.
** He prefers Om style - passing state explicitly to downstream components instead of referencing global state.
*** But he didn't do much ClojureScript development in the last year or so (e.g. re-frame got a lot better)

** In lots of applications, you don't need to make decisions about _REST_ and _GraphQL_ until you reach a certain size.
*** just pushing JSON data through APIs
*** If you know exactly what you're building and how big it's gonna be then it might be useful to pay that cost upfront.

* https://github.com/bhauman/strictly-specking[*_Strictly-specking_ library*]
** It was written mostly for the purpose of checking Figwheel/ClojureScript configuration options of which there are many and they're easy to get wrong.
** He started to write it in core.logic, then spec came out and he re-wrote it using spec.
*** Back then, spec was missing some features (it wasn't so easy to get an exact pointer to the problem inside the input data structure).
*** After that, there were some improvements to spec which made his job easier.

* *Spec error messages*
** Concerning Clojure.core we're talking about macros and special forms.
*** You get very detailed error messages - however, programming is a very incremental activity, and you just need a very brief and clear error message.
*** BUT, you can write a library that will match certain spec errors for core macros and output precise and clear user-facing error messages.

** When saying "better error messages", it helps to be a lot more precise what does that mean - e.g.
"We need a concise error message along with a pointer to the start and the end of the relevant code."
*** Unfortunately, that pointer is contextual - it depends on the file in which you are, etc.

** Bruce really wants better error messages to bring more people to Clojure - that's the reason why he is writing _https://github.com/bhauman/rebel-readline[rebel-readline]._

* https://github.com/bhauman/devcards[_*Devcards*_]
** All Bruce's projects are focused on bringing Clojure interactivity to people.
** When writing browser applications you always run in a broader context of the browser.
** Devcards' idea is that it should be easy to create independent pieces of an application and have them together.

* *Future* (ideas about Fighweel and more)
** Spec errors descriptions
** Keeping statistics and visual history of errors and messages.

** _Story_
*** He does https://github.com/bhauman/advent-of-clojure[Advent of Code] every year.
*** Working on programming projects let you reflect on our programming experience.
*** http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/[TIS 100 - assembly language programming  game] - the easiest way to learn assembly programming again.
*** REPL is kind of a game - idea of building challenges in REPL; he never got too far with this.

** Experienced Clojure programmers don't need a great REPL experience, but beginners need it.
*** When you're new to Clojure it's impossible to choose an editor - everybody says: "Cursive, Emacs, Atom, ..."
*** Ray: he struggled for one year or so to grasp the REPL - it's really a superpower of Clojure and now he uses it all the time.

** https://github.com/jline/jline3[JLine] provides a lot of functionality and makes things a lot easier.
** _rebel-_readline is practically an editor, and you can put many features there, but it's already great.
** IPython-like notebooks
*** Not being in a file feels very constraining.
*** You can use Devcards as a graphical REPL in a browser, and you have your code in a file!

** Reddit discussion: https://github.com/bhauman/rebel-readline/blob/master/README.md[Pre-release of rebel-readline by Bruce Hauman!
:D]
*** _But the greatest benefit for me is that we can finally show newcomers an almost proper Clojure workflow without sending them to setup Emacs/vim/Cursive first._

** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzbnk-zmSN0[*crepl* project idea]
*** collaborative REPL
*** Nice idea but they eventually ran out of money.
*** Tmux can be used for shared typing into REPL but you can't see who's typing what and when he typed.
*** Joke: _with Clojure we don't need multiple people;
we're so productive that just one man is enough._

** Bruce would like to have repl_-_readline ready for getting people's feedback in a couple of weeks.

* *JavaScript experience*
** Bruce enjoyed JavaScript back in time because of its dynamic nature.
** If he had a choice, he'd choose CoffeeScript.

* https://clojuriststogether.org/[_*Clojurists Together*_] *initiative*
** Figwheel is one of the sponsored projects.
** It's great; please join in and support Clojure open source projects!
