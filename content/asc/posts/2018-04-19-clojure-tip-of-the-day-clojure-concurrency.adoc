I've made a short "welcome" video for a new _Clojure Concurrency_ series.

You can find it on YouTube: https://youtu.be/LKomnPz4Kek.

Starting with this episode I probably won't make a separate blog post for each episode.
Instead, I'll attach all notes to the https://curiousprogrammer.net/clojure-tip-of-the-day-screencast/[Clojure Tip of the Day screencast page].
