I gave a talk at https://twitter.com/GDGJihlava[GDG Jihlava] yesterday about https://codescene.io[CodeScene], a unique behavioral code analysis tool that I'm grateful to work on.

The talk was given in Slovak (full details are available at the https://www.meetup.com/gdgjihlava/events/265293406/[Meetup page]).
