_Interesting stuff I did and found in the past week_.

## Clojure

### Clojurians slack excerpts

* _Frankline Apiyo May 4th at 7:01 PM What are some reasons for using fully qualified keywords as map keys?_
bfabry: spec, more precise automated refactoring, ability to add new information to a map without worrying about clashing key names
* _hiredman [about core.async usage] it is better to use >! and <! ops to communicate to impose ordering over trying to do it via close!_


### Random Clojure bits

I spent a frustrating hour debugging a large function using `name` as a map key
and also the `clojure.core/name` function (to convert a string to a keyword) at the same time.
It was pretty obvious once I removed most of the code but mysterious while trying to debug
the 70+ lines monster.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn- handle-login-callback [req]
(let [{:keys [id login name] :as user-info} {:id 123 :login "jumarko" :name "Juraj Martinka"}
provider-id :github
provider-name (name provider-id)]
provider-name))

#_(handle-login-callback {})
;;=> 
Unhandled java.lang.ClassCastException
class java.lang.String cannot be cast to class clojure.lang.IFn (java.lang.String is in module
java.base of loader 'bootstrap'; clojure.lang.IFn is in unnamed module of loader 'app')
----

The solution here is to either rename the extracted key or use the fully qualified version: `clojure.core/name`.
I went with `clojure.core.name`.


### JVM

https://stackoverflow.com/users/3448419/apangin[Andrei Pangin] (my favorite JVM expert) shared a snippet of Java code that can be used
to find out how much memory has been allocated by a single method:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61539760/benchmarking-jvm-memory-consumption-similarly-to-how-it-is-done-by-the-android-o

I translated it to Clojure:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn allocated-bytes [f]
(let [thread-mbean (java.lang.management.ManagementFactory/getThreadMXBean)
thread-id (.getId (Thread/currentThread))
start (.getThreadAllocatedBytes thread-mbean thread-id)]
(f)
(- (.getThreadAllocatedBytes thread-mbean thread-id)
start)))

(allocated-bytes #())
;; => 20336
(allocated-bytes (fn []))
;; => 20176
;; notice that JOL shown 29480 bytes for vector of 1000 numbers so this looks close
(allocated-bytes (fn [] (vec (range 1000000))))
;; => 29436912
----

You can find this snippet in my https://github.com/jumarko/clojure-experiments/blob/master/src/clojure_experiments/performance/memory.clj#L139-L155[clojure-experiments repository].


## Projects Update

### Python for Data Science

I continue reading the https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653[Python for Data Analysis book].
I've just started the chapter 5 about Pandas and learned about the fundamental concepts
like https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html[**Series**]
and https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html[**DataFrame**].

#### Series

_Series_ is like a 1-dimensional array / list with optional labels (index) for each value.
By default you the values are labeled from 0 to n-1, but you can specify your own _index_.
A natural way to do this is to simply use a dict to instantiate our Series object:

[source,python]
----
import pandas as pd
sdata = {'Ohio':35000, 'Texas':71000, 'Oregon':16000, 'Utah':5000}
states_ser = Series(sdata)
states_ser
#=>
Ohio      35000
Texas     71000
Oregon    16000
Utah       5000
dtype: int64

# or you can specify (perhaps a slightly different) index explicitly to override dict keys ordering
# - notice that 'California' yields NaN and 'Utah' is omitted
states = ['California', 'Ohio', 'Oregon', 'Texas']
states_ser_idx = Series(sdata, index=states)
states_ser_idx
#=>
California        NaN
Ohio          35000.0
Oregon        16000.0
Texas         71000.0
dtype: float64
----

#### DataFrame

_DataFrame_ can be visualized as a 2D table.


### https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html[SICP]

I made little progress last week - spent around 30 minutes on chapter 2.4.2.
They mention a good example of mixing multiple representations of complex numbers, _rectangular_
and _polar_, within the same program, and how that fits into broader **Stratified design** approach
(see page 140 in the book
and also https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6064/AIM-986.pdf;jsessionid=9B6B8F279FDAC150B9DCA19858ECB6A6?sequence=2[Lisp: A Language for Stratified Design]


image::/img/2020-05-11-weekly/sicp_multiple-data-representations_layers.jpg[SICP Figure 2.21 Structure of the generic complex-arithmetic system,600,450]

You can find relevant code here in my
https://github.com/jumarko/clojure-experiments/blob/master/src/clojure_experiments/books/sicp/ch2_abstractions_data/s4_multiple_representations.clj#L137-L224[clojure-experiments repository].


### https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-Global-ebook/dp/B07V71PHR7/ref=pd_sbs_14_1/130-8492999-1421206[Computer Systems]

I spent a quick 20-minute session by reading the chapter 3 (about machine code & assembler).
I learned about the differences between the (frequently used) ATT (AT&T) assembly syntax
and the Intel's assembly format: https://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html

image::/img/2020-05-11-weekly/cs-intel-vs-att-assembly.jpg[Intel vs. ATT assembly format]


**A few notable differences:**
- Instructions with multiple operands have arguments in **reversed order**; e.g. the first argument 
of the `mov` instruction is _destination_, not source
- There aren't different variants of a single instruction for different argument sizes (such as `movl` vs `movq` in ATT format);
instead, they are distinquished by special syntax like in `mov  QWORD PTR [rbx], rax`.

By default, gcc outputs ATT assembly but you can make it use Intel format via `-masm=intel`:

[source,bash]
----
gcc -Og -S  -masm=intel mstore.c -o mstore.intel.s
----


## Work (CodeScene)

### Azure Containers

Last week I talked about 
link:2020-05-04-weekly#_azure_containers_really_slow_io[performance issues when running CodeScene on Azure Container instances with mounted files shares].

I decided to perform more experiments:

* I tried a premium file share with 5 TB quota. According to Azure this should yield much better performance:
But I haven't noticed any real improvement over the basic 100 GB file share. An analysis was still
10x slower.
* I evaluated an alternative approach with using a file share only for the database (H2) file
and storing the rest (cloned repositories and analysis results) on a container's host file system.
This is **much better** and the analysis running time was close to what I observe on my laptop.

## Learning

### https://www.scotthyoung.com/courses/rapid-learner-course/[Rapid Learner]

I've been working on week 3 (Practice) which emphasizes importance of _real work_.
That is, if you want to really learn something in depth, you need to actually solve real problems.
For things like Math and Physics this means working on problem sets;
for programming it means to actually write code.

Week 3 lessons highlight topics and techniques like:

* _distributed practice_ (aka _spaced repetition_)
* _active recall_ (testing yourself without looking at the source material)
* _failure of transfer_ (inherent difficulties in applying what you learned in real world)
* _direct practice_ (working directly on the skill you want to improve; e.g. using the foreign language you want to learn)
** also _toy practice_ (e.g. Skype foreign language tutoring) as an easier form of _direct practice_ when you're not yet ready for real work

## Writing

I'm still looking ahead to fix issues with publishing Markdown on my wordpress blog
by migrating the blog to [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/) + GitHub pages.

In the meantime, I'm "publishing" these weekly bits & pieces in the github repository

## Personal (Hobbies)

There's a very special type of rock climbing available in Czech republic - sandstone trad climbing.
There are usually long distances between fixed protection points or they might be missing altogether.
It's not your typical limestone climbing.

We visited Český Ráj - Hruboskalsko to get a feeling of it. It was nice and we're still alive :).
