== The Wordpress problem ==

I wanted to migrate away from the existing Wordpress-based hosting for https://curiousprogrammer.net[my curiosprogrammer.net blog]
for a long time yet I have not found time to do that until now.
Today, I'm finally moving towards much simpler approach using https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen[Cryogen] as the underlying blog engine.

=== Cryogen ===

It's a simple blog engine written in Clojure.
It's used by a number of people in Clojure community, including:

- Sean Corfield: https://github.com/seancorfield/seancorfield.github.io
- Jakub Holy: https://blog.jakubholy.net/2019/migrating-from-gatsby-to-cryogen/

I think it will well serve my needs
and I hope that the friction for publishing posts (and the frustrations caused by Wordpress editor)
is going to disappear.

=== AsciiDoc ===

I've found a couple of AsciiDoc-related links in https://blog.jakubholy.net/2019/migrating-from-gatsby-to-cryogen/[Jakub Holy's article]
and decided to give it a try.
The promise is that it's better than Markdown (lack of standard and extensibility).
