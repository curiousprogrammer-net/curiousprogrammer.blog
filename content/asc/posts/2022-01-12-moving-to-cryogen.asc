== The Wordpress problem

I wanted to migrate away from the existing Wordpress-based hosting for
https://curiousprogrammer.net[my curiosprogrammer.net blog]
for a long time yet I have not found time to do that until now.
Today, I'm finally moving towards much simpler approach using
https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen[Cryogen] as the underlying blog engine.

== Cryogen

https://cryogenweb.org/[Cryogen] is a simple blog engine written in Clojure.
It's used by a number of people in Clojure community, including https://github.com/seancorfield/seancorfield.github.io[Sean Corfield] and https://blog.jakubholy.net/2019/migrating-from-gatsby-to-cryogen/[Jakub Holy].

I think it will well serve my needs
and I hope that the friction for publishing posts
(and the frustrations caused by Wordpress editor)
is going to diminish.

=== AsciiDoc

I've found a couple of AsciiDoc-related links in
https://blog.jakubholy.net/2019/migrating-from-gatsby-to-cryogen/[Jakub Holy's article]
and decided to give it a try.
The promise is that, unlike Markdown, it's standardized, extensible and has richer formatting options.

== Cloudflare pages

I was looking for a simple, free/cheap, robutst, and still powerful-enough static site hosting.

I considered GitHub Pages but they are rather crude and don't offer much options.
In particular, I wanted to configure redirects for my old curiousprogrammer.net blog posts.

I finally found https://pages.cloudflare.com/[Cloudflare Pages] and didn't look further
I already had a Cloudflare account because I've been using Cloudflare for a few of my domains
so it was really quick to set it up and have a dev version of the blog up running.

If you are interested,
check their https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started[Get Started docs page].


== The old blog/content

I'm working on moving the posts and pages from my old Wordpress-based blog site
to the new format.
I'll post an update once that's ready.
