For way too long I've been frustrated by cloudwatch's inability to produce human-readable timestamps.

Consider this example: footnote:[You could get result like this by using something like `_stats latest(@timestamp) by ..._` in your Cloudwatch Insights query]

Today, I wrote a small piece of JavaScript which I can quickly copy-paste into browser's Dev Tools console:

[source,javascript]
----
// paste this into browser's JS console - adjust CSS class name as needed
document.getElementsByClassName("logs-table__body-cell").forEach( // <1>
  function(element) {
    var content = element.textContent
    timestamp = parseInt(content);
    if (!isNaN(timestamp) && timestamp > 1000000000) {
      var humanDate = new Date(timestamp).toLocaleString();
      console.log(timestamp + "=> " + humanDate);
      // replace timestamp with human-readable date
      element.innerHTML = humanDate;
  }
});
----
<1> `_logs-table__body-cell_` is the CSS class name that the UI uses for cells in the result table.
If the script doesn't work, make sure to open the insepector and check the cell class name.

*Now it looks much better!*
