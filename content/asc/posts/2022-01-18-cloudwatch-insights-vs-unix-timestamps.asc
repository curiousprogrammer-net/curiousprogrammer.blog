For way too long,
I've been frustrated by inability of the Cloudwatch Insights UI console to produce
https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=311368[human-readable output of latest/earliest functions].

Consider this example: footnote:[I did try using `_tomillis_` function as suggested in
link:https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=311368[the thread reply]
but it didn't work - it still shows up as a number, not a date]

[source]
----
fields @timestamp, @message
| parse /version=(?<my_version>\d\.\d.\d)/
| stats latest(@timestamp) as latest_version_check,
  count(@message) as checks_count
  by my_version
| sort by latest_version_check desc
| display latest_version_check, my_version, checks_count
----

This produces a table where the `_latest_version_check_` will be formatted as a plain unix timestamp (in milliseconds):

Having a human-readable date/time would be so much more useful!

## The solution/workaround

I wrote a small piece of JavaScript which I can quickly copy-paste into browser's Dev Tools console:

[source,javascript]
----
// paste this into browser's JS console - adjust CSS class name as needed
document.getElementsByClassName("logs-table__body-cell").forEach( // <1>
  function(element) {
    var content = element.textContent
    timestamp = parseInt(content);
    if (!isNaN(timestamp) && timestamp > 1000000000) {
      var humanDate = new Date(timestamp).toLocaleString();
      console.log(timestamp + " => " + humanDate);
      // replace timestamp with human-readable date
      element.innerHTML = humanDate;
  }
});
----
<1> `_logs-table__body-cell_` is the CSS class name that the UI uses for cells in the result table.
If the script doesn't work, make sure to open the insepector and check the cell class name.

### Now it looks much better!
