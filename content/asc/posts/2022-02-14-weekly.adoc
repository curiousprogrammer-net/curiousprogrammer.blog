_Some of the interesting things I did, learned, or found in the past week_.

## PF.tv Domain Modeling series

I've been reading through some more Domain Modeling posts on the PurelyFunctional.tv blog,
notably:

### https://purelyfunctional.tv/issues/purelyfunctional-tv-newsletter-457-take-a-stance/[457: Take a stance]

People are often worried they create a wrong model because they cannot predict the future.

Let's analyse the fear:

1. Don't worry - your model is already wrong
    * if you don't even *write it down* then you will never learn how bad it is
2. No model is perfect - just finding a better model (fit) will be great => fewer corner cases, less code, more development speed
3. *You can change the model later* - it's just code and data (although it's more expensive as you have more data and handle more use cases)
4. *Build flexilibility into your model* - if you can predict specific areas where you need it (follow your fear to explore such areas)
    * For instance, modeling pizza toppings (that can change even daily) by allowing ingredients to change quickly
    and easily (one option is to store them in a DB table instead of hard-coding)
5. *Push decisions into a higher layer* (make the lower layer more generic than immediately needed)
    * e.g. using inches to measure a diameter of pizzas - at the higher level, you can translate inches into 'small', 'medium', 'large'
    * *good domain models are more general than we need* at the moment => we can reuse them in novel situations
6. *Have the conversation* - with business stakeholders and customers
    * domain model *constraints are helpful* (e.g. having only rounded pizzas, not squares)
    * if they want arbitrary shapes, we need to consider that but otherwise we shouldn't allow for arbitrary things in our model


### https://purelyfunctional.tv/issues/purelyfunctional-tv-newsletter-458-three-doorways-of-domain-modeling/[458: Three doorways of domain modeling]

The three levels for Domain Modeling - more fundamental first - are: 

1. *data modeling* - some data models fit the world better
** mirror the structure of the domain - evaluate language features (such as interfaces and enums) for their modelling potential
2. *operations first* - realize that you can design the operations over the data independently of the representation of the data
** design operations ahead of the data model and analyze how those operations constrain the data modling choices
3. *algebraic composition* - some set of operations are more expressive than others
** designing operations to compose - design algebraic properties of your operatios to create expressive domain languages


### https://purelyfunctional.tv/issues/purelyfunctional-tv-newsletter-460-interface-polymorphism/[460: Interface polymorphism]

* An Interface encodes *alternatives*
* Suggested approach: *find the alternatives* - identify them and see how fast they change -> e.g. coffee sizes:
** if the coffee sizes  don't often vary, use an enum
** if you add/remove sizes weekly, perhaps an interface is best
** if it changes daily, you may need something better - perhaps store the sizes in the database ("data class" approach)
* We need to talk more about **correctly choosing our abstractions to encode a domain model** and less about rules of thumb for making code more maintainable

## Clojure

### Fixing Cryogen's auto-refresh

I was missing the auto-refresh feature when working on the blog posts and finally figured it out.

See https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C0M8UK760/p1644318541889299[my conversation on Clojuarians slack];

* There's a server option called `:fast` that I tried, but it doesn't seem to work: https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen/blob/master/src/leiningen/new/cryogen/src/cryogen/server.clj#L84
** there's even alias :fast  in deps.edn (although it's missing :exec-fn)
** => I fixed the alias here: https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen/pull/250[Add missing :exec-fn to the :fast alias in deps.edn. #250]
* It still didn't work for me because the Nucleus template uses another function window.onload which overwrites the javascript used by ring's refresh mechanism
** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18369255/window-onload-not-working-for-very-simple-page
** https://github.com/curiousprogrammer-net/curiousprogrammer.blog/pull/27/files#diff-8fede33b17fa310c20302402b6f42aa49e09ad809d379004a22460216b0f1d68[I fixed this in my own blog setup]
* I also created an issue about this: https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen/issues/251[Auto-refresh feature doesn't work with Nucleus template. #251]

### Can "NUMA" cause mysterious performance degradations?

You'll find an interesting discussion in a couple of blog posts and related links:

* https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C8NUSGWG6/p1644415226712619[Clojurians slack discussion^]

### Core.async - channels as queues?

https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C05423W6H/p1644512908298649[hiredman in #core-async^] (Clojurians slack) _channels as collections is also pretty "meh"_

* *channels are synchronization points between processes, that have queue like behaviors*
* Ben Sless: Channels are queue like, but I can reduce a java Queue. It might be nonsensical, but I don't see a reason why reducing over a channel can't return a channel which will contain a result sometime in the future like it does in core.async.
* hiredman channels are queues, but *what they queue isn't values, they queue threads of execution*
** *channels are points where threads of execution can exchange values*, and if no thread is currently at that point, a thread of execution can be queued waiting for another to arrive to exchange a value with

## AWS & Cloud

### AWS Lambda deployment with Terraform

I had a lot of fun deploying a new lambda function with Terraform this week.
There are quite a few steps you need to accomplish even for such a simple thing and I think it's useful to summarize them.
I'll try to do that in a *future blog post*.

### AWS Secrets Manager and the principle of least-privilege

AWS Secrets Manager is a great place to store secrets that are needed by somebody else (machines or people)
if you are running your infrastructure on AWS.

You can give subjects (users, groups, or roles) accesss only to specific secrets following
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege[the principle of least privilege].

*I wrote a separate blog post about this topic:
link:/posts/2022-02-16-aws-secrets-manager-least-privilege[AWS Secrets Manager and the principle of least-privilege]

### AWS Load Balancers - increasing the idle connection timeout


[On https://devopsengineers.com/[DevOps Engineers slack^]] _Is there any downside to *increasing the idle connection timeout on an ALB* (assuming it's still less than the application timeout)?_

* Cost would be the big one.  Scaling not so much
* LCUs [Load Balancer Capacity Units] are based on new and active connections (plus rule evals and bytes processed) so keeping the connection open would increase LCUs/cost.  It is wise to keep it > than the app timeout, Iâ€™ve ran into issues where the app timeout was set to X and the ALB timeout was X-Y and had connections drop in the middle of large uploads, etc.

## Books


### https://pragprog.com/titles/ehxta/explore-it/[Explore it!^]

This book looks really good and I'm looking forward to reading it.

From https://pragprog.com/titles/ehxta/explore-it/[the publisher's blurb^]:

[quote]
____
Rather than designing all tests in advance, explorers design and execute small, rapid experiments, using what they learned from the last little experiment to inform the next.
Learn essential skills of a master explorer, including how to analyze software to discover key points of vulnerability, how to design experiments on the fly, how to hone your observation skills, and how to focus your efforts.

### https://github.com/jumarko/grokking-simplicity[Grokking Simplicity^]

Quick notes from chapter 4: _Extracting calculations from actions_:

* Actions spread
* *Implicit vs explicit inputs & outputs*
**  inputs - information from the outside that the function uses in a computation
** outputs - information or actions that leave the function
** implicit inputs: e.g. modifying global variable; explicit inputs: function's arguments
** implicit outputs: e.g. updating a DOM element or printing to the conslle; explicit outputs: function's return value
* Implicit inputs or outputs make a function an action!


### https://github.com/jumarko/api-security-in-action[Api Security in Action^]

#### Session fixation, Cookies, Sub-domain hijacking

On pages 119-125 they cover various interesting topics:

* mitigating *session fixation attacks* by always creating a new session on login
* *Useful cookies attributes:*
** `Secure` - can only be sent over HTTPS
** `HttpOnly` - using this it's harder to steal cookies via XSS attacks
** `SameSite` - only sent on reuests that originate from the same origin as the cookie
** `Domain` - preffer not setting it => the cookie will become host-only
** `Path` - set it to "/" if you want the cookie to be sent for all API requets because otherwise the default is the parent of the request that returned the Set-Cookie header
*** limited security benefits - easy to hack by creating a hidden iframe with correct path
** `Max-Age` - makes the cookie persistent (non-persistent cookie is removed when the browser closes)
*** avoid setting it for session cookies BUT still enforce maximum session time on the server - one reason for this is that browsers support session restoration 
** check also standard cookie prefixes like `+__Secure-+` and `+__Host-+`
* *Sub-domain hijacking* - due to abandoned DNS records -> often problem on shared hostings like GitHub Pages

#### CSRF

The next section (p. 125-133) talks about CSRF :

* APIs that serve browser clients may still be vulnerable to CSRF and need to build in protection mechanisms
* One of the most effective way are *double submit cookies* - the variant where the second token is cryptographically bound to the session cookie
** This picture shows two tokens/cookies - session cookie, which is `HttpOnly`, and the second `csrfToken` cookie which is _cryptographically bound_ to the session cookie by using the `SHA-256` hash function:
+
image::/img/2022-02-14-weekly/double-submit-cookies.png[double-submit cookies]
* Base64: url-safe variant is in common use for web apis because it can be safely used in URLs
(see also link:/posts/2022-02-19-base64[Base 64 encoding, padding, and URLs])
* The meat of the code checking the tokens: 
+
[source,java]
----
// the provided token is expected to be Base64-encoded version of SHA256 of session token
var tokenId = request.headers("X-CSRF-Token");
var providedToken = Base64Url.decode(tokenId);
var computedToken =  sha256(session.id());
if (!MessageDigest.isEqual(providedToken, computedToken)) {
    // somebody is trying to forge the token?
    return Optional.empty();
}

// here's the code to compute sha256
MessageDigest.getInstance("sha256").digest(tokenId.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
----


### https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Monitoring-Effective-Strategies-World/dp/1491957352[Practical Monitoring] - chapter 5 about Business Metrics

This chapter focuses on business KPIs and is extremely useful.

* Things that stakeholders care about (questions they ask):
** Can customers use the service and are they happy?
** Are we making money?
** Are we growing?
* Common business metrics (p. 58): MRR, Revenue per customer, NPS, LTV, CAC, Customer churn, Active users, etc.
* 2 real-world examples: Yelp and Reddit
** Yelp: searches performed, reviews placed, user signups, active users, active businesess, ads purchases
** Reddit: users currently on site, user logins, comments posted, threads submitted, votes, private messages sent, ads purchased
* Connecting Business KPIs to Technical metrics: 
** splitting things like _User logins_ into more specific metrics like __login **failures**__ and _login **latency**_

## Writing

Apart from this weekly summary I published a couple short posts:

* link:/posts/2022-02-16-aws-secrets-manager-least-privilege[AWS Secrets Manager and the principle of least-privilege]
* link:/posts/2022-02-19-base64[Base 64 encoding, padding, and URLs].


## MISC

### Base64 encoding

A colleague added spec for base64 encoded values in our codebase
and that made me check what is actually a valid set of characters
in a Base64-encoded string.

*I wrote a separate post about this topic:  
link:/posts/2022-02-19-base64[Base 64 encoding, padding, and URLs]*.


### https://www.cognitect.com/cognicast/155[Cognicast with Camille Fournier]

* "Leadership" is not the same as "People managment"
** we shouldn't force technical leaders into people management
* Technical skills are critical for engineering managers
** so they gain credibility among engineers
** they need understanding, appreciation and taste for their engineers' work
* Strategic thinking and building culture & engagement is hard when working fully remote


### VisiData - a great tool for exploring CSV (and many other formats) on the command line

VisiData is an extremely interesting and useful command-line tool
for exploring tabular, CSV, JSON, and other formats.

Make sure to check
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1CBDTgGtOU[VisiData Lightning Demo at PyCascades 2018].

*My favorite stuff:*

* `Shift + I` -> descriptive statistics for the dataset
* `Shift + F` -> frequency table (histogram)
* filtering: `\` to select relevent rows, then `"` to open the current selection as a new sheet
