_Some of the interesting things I did, learned, or found recently.

## Clojure


### https://grishaev.me/en/clj-book-systems/[Systems in Clojure^]

[Clojure in production^]
* looks quite useful, detailed and covers component and integrant


## Reading (Books)

### Lisp in Small Pieces

I've been working on chapter 2 which is all about Lisp2, dynamic variables, and recursion.
It's been an interesting exploration of various approaches - tThe authors articulate pros and cons of each
and go really deep into some topics.

It ends with a discussion of Y-combinator and _fixed point_ in general.


## MISC

### Steve Yegge videos
