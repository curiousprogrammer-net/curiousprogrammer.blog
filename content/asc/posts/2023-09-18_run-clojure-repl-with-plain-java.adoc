_This is gonna be a rather short and trivial post but I wanted to share it anyway
because it can be useful, ocassionally._

Recently, I needed to test a piece of Clojure code without having to access to
https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure[clojure installation^].
There were two such places:

1. Inside a Docker container
2. Windows VM

For the Windows VM, I couldn't install Clojure at all - the https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows[official instructions^]
didn't work.

Fortunately, I remembered the _"Clojure is just a JAR"_ meme footnote:[Nowawdays, a more accurate description would be "Clojure is just a _collection_ of JARs"].

## Download

I began, by downloading Clojure JARs for the https://clojure.org/releases/downloads[current release^].

* https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar
* https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/clojure/spec.alpha/0.3.218/spec.alpha-0.3.218.jar
* https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/clojure/core.specs.alpha/0.2.62/core.specs.alpha-0.2.62.jar

Notice that you need to download a couple of other JARs, not just the clojure artifact.
That's because in Clojure 1.9,
https://clojure.org/releases/devchangelog#_1_9spec_split_apr_26_2017[Spec was moved into a separate library^]
to make it easier to evolve it independently from Clojure.


## Run 

Once you have all the artifacts in place, getting the REPL is easy:

```
java -cp clojure-1.11.1.jar:spec.alpha-0.3.218.jar:core.specs.alpha-0.2.62.jar clojure.main
Clojure 1.11.1
user=> (println "Hello REPL!")
Hello REPL!
```

That's all you need for a very basic exploration of the code.
