Here's a small Keyboard Maestor macro I made today:

This opens the link/URL that's under the cursor.

## How it works

First, it types the `Cmd + K` shortcut which opens this dialog in Evernote:

Then it types `TAB` to move the focus to the URL.

The `Copy` action simply copies the highlighted URL to the system clipboard
and the `Open URL` actions uses opens the link stored in the clipboard.
