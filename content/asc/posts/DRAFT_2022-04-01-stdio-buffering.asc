## TODO



http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/stdio_buffering/[Linux pipes and standard streams buffering problems]

    * Default Buffering modes:
        * stdin is buffered (line buffering doesn't affect stdin)
        * stdout is buffered (line buffered if connected to a terminal)
        * stderr is unbuffered
    * Default Buffer sizes:
        * Buffer size only directly affects buffered mode
        * The default size like the kernel is based on the page size (4096 bytes on my system)
        * if stdin/stdout are connected to a terminal then default size = 1024; else size = 4096

        *  and hence will automatically buffer up data into 4096 byte chunks before sending to uniq.
        * Note tail's stdout buffer would also have this problem, but tail -f calls fflush on the stdout stream when new data is received to alleviate this (as do tcpdump -l, grep --line-buffered and sed --unbuffered for example).
        * Note also that uniq's stdout buffer is connected to a terminal and so will be automatically flushed when a new line is written to it which is fine for our needs.
