This is a brief post about the way I set up jenv
and a couple of issues that you may encounter when using it.


## jenv init script

You will need to fix this after every upgrade
```
source '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jenv/0.5.7/libexec/libexec/../completions/jenv.zsh'
```

so it might be better to use '*':
```
# changed hardcoded "0.5.6" version here to '*' to avoid troubles after jenv upgrades
source /opt/homebrew/Cellar/jenv/*/libexec/libexec/../completions/jenv.zsh

```

See my ~/.zshrc file.


## JAVA_HOME Is tricky!

- it works for me for local versions but not global ("system")
```
$  jenv local 21.0
$ cd .
$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/Users/jumar/.jenv/versions/21.0

$ ls -l /Users/jumar/.jenv/versions/21.0
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 jumar  staff  62 Feb 22 21:45 /Users/jumar/.jenv/versions/21.0 -> /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-21.jdk/Contents/Home

# but "system does not exist"
$ rm .java_version
$ ls -l $JAVA_HOME
ls: /Users/jumar/.jenv/versions/system: No such file or directory
```
- => THE FIX: use jenv global
```
jenv global 21.0
```
