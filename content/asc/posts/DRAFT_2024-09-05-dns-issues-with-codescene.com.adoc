We had this case on 5th Sep 2024 when codescene.com was mysteriously slow or unavailable for certain clients.
It turned out, our domain email verification expired - that was one problem.
But then Google DNS servers had issues (very slow resolution)
and also the old/new nameservers config wasn't propagated fast enough.
