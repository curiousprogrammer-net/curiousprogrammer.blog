A nuance.

## It's not that simple.

In technology, people often say things like: "Outsource/buy stuff that's not core to your business. Only build stuff where your core focus / expertise is".

I don't think that captures the all of it.
The trouble is that "Buy" is at odds with learning.
You are diminishing your skills and capabilities to be independent.
You "outsource" your skills - possibly forever.
By not learning, you become ignorant and incapable of good judgment.
