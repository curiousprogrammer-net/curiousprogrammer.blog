my curiosprogrammer.net blog
for a long time yet I have not found time to do that until now.
Today, I’m finally moving towards much simpler approach using
Cryogen as the underlying blog engine.CryogenCryogen is a simple blog engine written in Clojure.
It’s used by a number of people in Clojure community, including Sean Corfield and Jakub Holy.I think it will well serve my needs
and I hope that the friction for publishing posts
(and the frustrations caused by Wordpress editor)
is going to diminish.AsciiDocI’ve found a couple of AsciiDoc-related links in
Jakub Holy’s article
and decided to give it a try.
The promise is that, unlike Markdown, it’s standardized, extensible and has richer formatting options.See:Why You Shouldn’t Use “Markdown” for DocumentationCompare AsciiDoc to MarkdownAsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
