for a long time yet I have not found time to do that until now.
Today, I’m finally moving towards much simpler approach using Cryogen as the underlying blog engine.Cryogen ===It’s a simple blog engine written in Clojure.
It’s used by a number of people in Clojure community, including:Sean Corfield: https://github.com/seancorfield/seancorfield.github.ioJakub Holy: https://blog.jakubholy.net/2019/migrating-from-gatsby-to-cryogen/I think it will well serve my needs
and I hope that the friction for publishing posts (and the frustrations caused by Wordpress editor)
is going to disappear.AsciiDocI’ve found a couple of AsciiDoc-related links in Jakub Holy’s article
and decided to give it a try.
The promise is that it’s better than Markdown (lack of standard and extensibility).See:Why You Shouldn’t Use “Markdown” for DocumentationCompare AsciiDoc to Markdown</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
